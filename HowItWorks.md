# How VeriAI Works: Technical Overview

## Executive Summary

VeriAI is a blockchain-based verification platform that provides cryptographic proof of AI-generated content authenticity. By leveraging decentralized oracle networks and NFT technology, VeriAI creates immutable certificates that verify the provenance, integrity, and authenticity of AI-generated content.

## The Problem Statement

In an era where AI-generated content is increasingly prevalent, organizations and individuals face critical challenges:

- **Authenticity Verification**: Difficulty proving that content was actually generated by a specific AI model
- **Content Integrity**: No reliable method to verify that AI-generated content hasn't been modified post-generation
- **Provenance Tracking**: Inability to demonstrate the original prompts and parameters used for content generation
- **Trust Deficit**: Lack of standardized verification mechanisms for AI-assisted work

## Solution Architecture

VeriAI addresses these challenges through a three-tier verification system:

### 1. **Blockchain-Backed Request Registration**

- All verification requests are immutably recorded on the Flare blockchain
- Each request receives a unique cryptographic identifier
- Timestamp and user attribution are permanently preserved

### 2. **Decentralized Oracle Consensus**

- Multiple independent oracles simultaneously query the specified AI model
- Consensus mechanisms ensure result authenticity through majority agreement
- Byzantine fault tolerance protects against malicious or erroneous responses

### 3. **NFT Certificate Generation**

- Successful verifications generate unique ERC-721 compliant NFT certificates
- Each certificate contains comprehensive metadata about the verification process
- Certificates serve as portable, verifiable proof of content authenticity

## Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Content Generation Request

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant VeriAI Frontend
    participant VeriAI Backend
    participant Blockchain

    User->>VeriAI Frontend: Submit prompt & model selection
    VeriAI Frontend->>VeriAI Backend: API request with parameters
    VeriAI Backend->>Blockchain: Record verification request
    Blockchain-->>VeriAI Backend: Return request ID
    VeriAI Backend-->>User: Confirmation & request tracking
```

**Process Details:**

1. User submits content generation request through VeriAI interface
2. System validates input parameters and calculates verification fee
3. Request is cryptographically signed and recorded on blockchain
4. Unique request identifier is generated for tracking purposes

### Phase 2: Decentralized Verification

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Blockchain
    participant Oracle 1
    participant Oracle 2
    participant Oracle N
    participant AI Provider
    participant Consensus Engine

    Blockchain->>Oracle 1: Broadcast verification request
    Blockchain->>Oracle 2: Broadcast verification request
    Blockchain->>Oracle N: Broadcast verification request

    Oracle 1->>AI Provider: Query with specified parameters
    Oracle 2->>AI Provider: Query with specified parameters
    Oracle N->>AI Provider: Query with specified parameters

    AI Provider-->>Oracle 1: Return AI response
    AI Provider-->>Oracle 2: Return AI response
    AI Provider-->>Oracle N: Return AI response

    Oracle 1->>Consensus Engine: Submit response hash
    Oracle 2->>Consensus Engine: Submit response hash
    Oracle N->>Consensus Engine: Submit response hash

    Consensus Engine->>Blockchain: Record consensus result
```

**Consensus Mechanism:**

- **Threshold**: Minimum 67% oracle agreement required for verification
- **Timeout**: 300-second maximum response window
- **Validation**: Cryptographic hash comparison ensures response integrity
- **Slashing**: Malicious oracles face economic penalties

### Phase 3: Certificate Generation

Upon successful consensus, the system:

1. **Generates Content Hash**: SHA-256 hash of the verified AI response
2. **Creates Metadata Structure**: Comprehensive verification details
3. **Mints NFT Certificate**: ERC-721 token with embedded metadata
4. **Transfers Certificate**: NFT sent to requester's wallet address

## NFT Certificate Structure

Each VeriAI certificate contains the following immutable metadata:

```json
{
  "requestId": "0x7d1a...",
  "prompt": "Original user prompt",
  "model": "AI model identifier",
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601 timestamp",
  "contentHash": "SHA-256 hash of AI response",
  "verificationProof": {
    "consensusHash": "0x9f2b...",
    "oracleCount": 5,
    "agreementThreshold": "67%",
    "verificationTime": "2025-09-06T10:30:00Z"
  },
  "blockchain": {
    "network": "Flare",
    "blockNumber": 12345678,
    "transactionHash": "0x8e3c..."
  }
}
```
